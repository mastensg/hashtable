do it!

singly-linked lists for buckets
uint64_t key -> uint64_t value

1. define interface, write hashtable.h
2. write client code, sequence of asserts in main.c
3. keep implementing a hashtable in one.c until all the tests pass

build environment:
    clang-5.0 -std=c11 \
        -Weverything -fcolor-diagnostics \
        -Wno-switch-enum \
        -fsanitize=address,integer,undefined \
        -march=native -O0 -g -o \
        test_one main.c one.c
compile and run every time one of the files are saved

i read about linked allocation in knuth's taocp vol 1.
i had a revelation about memory allocation.
man, what a good book.

--------------------------------  2017-06-10  --------------------------------

keep doing it.

i think i can assign and lookup now.

i'm using alexei alexandrescu's for(;;) method.

i think i implemented deletion just now.
the tests seem to all pass, but:

    ==1133==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks

    Direct leak of 24 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:

    SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 24 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).

ah, my ht_free only frees the array of buckets, but not the list elements.
thanks, leaksanitizer! :D

i'm reminded of a recent file descriptor leak in synq's thumbnail service.
a go program didn't close its descriptors, and would crash.
i wonder if there's a file descriptor leak detector...
there's this for java: file-leak-detector.kohsuke.org/
and as i just found, there's valgrind's --track-fds.
there may be a whole bunch of correctness checkers out there that i don't know of.
i will read the clang, gcc and valgrind manuals one day to discover them!

back to freeing memory.
1. for each bucket, free all the elements
2. free the array of buckets

for each list element, save its pointer to the next element, and then free the element

now there's a heap-use-after-free but clang's AddressSanitizer doesn't give line numbers.
i'll switch to gcc.
ah, i think i see now.
the **p style iteration doesn't apply/isn't needed when freeing.

i think it's good! :D
if only i had these sanitizers when starting out with c...

next up, property-based testing with hypothesis.

--------------------------------  2017-06-11  --------------------------------

idea (had when reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_hashing):
with a scheme that only let elements with the same hash value share a location,
the elements in that area don't need to store the whole key -- only the
non-hash part of the key.
for example, the hash can be the least significant bits of an integer,
and the partial key stored in the table can be the most significant bits.

                                     * * *

now, how about that hypothesis...

1. wrap one.c with cffi
2. implement a hashtable.h interface around python's dict
3. make a hypothesis strategy

i started by adapting my "real" cffi example from yesterday.
i don't want to have cffi compile anything, though, i think.
maybe i want the out-of-line, abi level:
https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#out-of-line-abi-level

i'm going through the list of methods in help(dict), and filling in my own
Hashtable object.
i'm making my c hashtable conform to python's dict's interface, instead of the
other way around.
it's kinda fun :)
i have keep_doing_it.sh running in a window on the side, of course.
this is the nice and easy reward after having done the tricky linked list stuff
in c! :p

now there's a hypothesis test suite! :D
and one.c passes it!
it inserts a bunch of key-value pairs into my hashtable and python's dict, and
then asserts that they both contain the same values.
and they do -- at least hypothesis hasn't found a falsifying example yet.
